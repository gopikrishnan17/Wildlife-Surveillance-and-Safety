# Wildlife-Surveillance-and-Safety
**Overview:**
A Raspberry Pi device that uses video input to determine presence of wild animals and notifies officials via text.

**Working:**
The file "animaldetect1.py" contains the code to implement animal/human detection and also sends notification via telegram bot. The code takes in input from camera module connected to a Raspberry Pi 4 which is analysed using Mobilenet SSD algorithm to find presence of any animals/humans in the video. If presence is detected, notification is sent to officials via a telegram bot
